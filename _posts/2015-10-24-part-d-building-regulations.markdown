# This is what I learned in markdown today

Part D of the building regulations contains the requirements for structure. This will ensure that buildings are able to withstand all the various loadings that they are subject to. This should include dead live and wind loading. The building structure should be able to fransfer all the forces to the ground safety.

## level two heading

I was reading an article the other day and this is a quote from the article:

### my first _unordered_ list

* rest

### my ordered list **the same items**

1. rest
2. relax
3. enjoy
4. compute
5. learn jekyll

print_hi('Tom')
