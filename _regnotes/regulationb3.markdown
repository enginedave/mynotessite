        <strong>Internal fire spread (structure)</strong><br>
        <strong>B3.</strong><br>
            (1) The building shall be designed and constructed so that, in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a reasonable period.<br>
            (2) A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-detached house are each to be treated as a separate building.<br>
            (3) Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent appropriate to the size and intended use of the building, comprising either or both of the following:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) sub-division of the building with fire-resisting construction;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) installation of suitable automatic fire supression systems.<br>
            (4) The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.

      <h4>Solid Party Wall</h4>
      <p><em>
      Party wall between the two properties to be constructed using 215mm solid blockwork construction to achieve minimum 1hr fire resistance. Wall to be continued up to the underside of the roof covering and fire stopped. Space between the roof battens to be fire stopped along the line of the party wall.

      <h4>Cavity Party Wall</h4>
      <p><em>
      Party wall between the two properties to be constructed using 2no. 100mm skins constructed in blockwork to achieve 1hr fire resistance. Wall to be continued up to the underside of the roof covering and fire stopped. Space between the roof battens to be fire stopped along the line of the party wall.

      <h4>Timber Framed Party Wall</h4>
      <p><em>
        Party wall between the two properties to be constructed using timber stud construction as per the timber frame manufacturers timber sizes. Internally the timber studs should be finished (both sides) using an inner layer of 19mm Gyproc plank and an outer layer of 12.5mm Gyproc WallBoard to provide 1hr fire resistance. There should be no service penetrations through either of these layers to maintain the integrity of the fire resisting wall.<br><br>
        If services are required on the party wall then a suitable depth timber batten should be used to provide the services zone and the wall finished with a further 12.5mm layer of Gyproc WallBoard.<br><br>
