        <strong>Internal fire spread (structure)</strong><br>
        <strong>B3.</strong><br>
            (1) The building shall be designed and constructed so that, in the event of fire, its stability will be maintained for a reasonable period.<br>
            (2) A wall common to two or more buildings shall be designed and constructed so that it adequately resists the spread of fire between those buildings. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph a house in a terrace and a semi-detached house are each to be treated as a separate building.<br>
            (3) Where reasonably necessary to inhibit the spread of fire within the building, measures shall be taken, to an extent appropriate to the size and intended use of the building, comprising either or both of the following:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) sub-division of the building with fire-resisting construction;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) installation of suitable automatic fire supression systems.<br>
            (4) The building shall be designed and constructed so that the unseen spread of fire and smoke within concealed spaces in its structure and fabric is inhibited.
