# this is regulation 17

Regulation 17 says some thing like you must do this and this in order to reduce the amount of energy that is being used. by the building.

this is my suggested drawing notes to comply with regulation 17.

the walls should be constructed to with the insulation as shown in the following table. This will ensure that the u-values are less that the requirements so that tge DER will be less than the TER. For more information on compliance refer to the SAP calculations.
